## Project Overview

JMT Travel, a leading adventure tourism company, was losing 68% of customers during their checkout process for group bookings. The challenge: transform a complex, multi-person reservation system into a frictionless experience that could handle the unique complexities of adventure travel bookings.

---

## The Problem

The original checkout process suffered from several critical issues:

1. **Abandonment Rate:** 68% of users abandoned during checkout
2. **Group Booking Friction:** Adding multiple travelers required starting over
3. **Payment Confusion:** Unclear deposit vs. full payment options
4. **Mobile Experience:** Nearly unusable on smaller screens (76% of traffic)

---

## Research & Discovery

### User Research
- Conducted 28 user interviews with past customers
- Analyzed 1,200+ session recordings
- Created 4 user personas representing key customer segments

### Key Insights
- 72% of bookings involved coordinating between 3+ travelers
- Payment flexibility (deposits, installments) was critical for high-value trips
- Users needed clear confirmation of booking details before payment

---

## Solution Design

### UX Improvements
- **Multi-traveler Management:** Single-page interface for adding/editing all travelers
- **Flexible Payment System:** Visual toggle between deposit/full payment with transparent fee structure
- **Mobile-first Redesign:** Completely rebuilt for small screens with thumb-friendly interaction zones
- **Progress Indicator:** Clear 4-step process with ability to save and return

### Technical Implementation
- React frontend with modular components for each checkout section
- Custom Stripe integration for flexible payment handling
- Persistent state management to prevent data loss
- Optimized API calls to reduce loading times by 67%

---

## Testing & Iteration

### A/B Testing
- Tested 3 variations of the payment selection interface
- Ran multivariate tests on form field ordering
- Tested copy variations for clarity

### Iterations
- Simplified traveler information collection based on user feedback
- Added "save and share" functionality for group organizers
- Implemented smart defaults based on destination type

---

## Results

- **Conversion Rate:** Increased from 32% to 64% (+100%)
- **Mobile Completion:** Improved by 215%
- **Average Booking Value:** Increased by 24% due to better upsell integration
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Post-booking survey scores improved from 6.8/10 to 9.2/10

---

## Business Impact

- **Revenue Increase:** $4.2M additional annual revenue from conversion improvements
- **Operational Efficiency:** 42% reduction in customer service calls about checkout issues
- **Group Bookings:** 37% increase in multi-person reservations

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Breaking complex forms into logical steps dramatically improved completion
- **Shared Context:** Group booking tools need shared information visibility
- **Payment Psychology:** Visualizing payment options increased willingness to commit
