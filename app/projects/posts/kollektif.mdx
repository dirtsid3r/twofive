## Project Overview

Kollektif, a Copenhagen-based talent agency, needed a brand identity and digital platform to reflect their mission: bridging Nordic design rigor with the raw energy of global creative talent. The challenge? **Avoid clichÃ©d "Scandi minimalism" while staying authentically Danish.**

---

## Branding Strategy

### Visual Identity
- **Dynamic Logomark:** A morphing "K" symbolizing collaboration, built with scalable vector animation.
- **Color Palette:** Arctic neutrals (navy, ice white) + vibrant accents inspired by global street art.
- **Typography:** Balto (Danish modern) paired with Editorial New (editorial edge).

### Key Design Principles
1. **Flexibility:** Assets adapt to music, film, and art talent niches.
2. **Motion First:** Micro-animations reflect creative energy (GSAP-powered hover states).
3. **Anti-Portfolio:** Avoided sterile grids â€“ talent showcased through immersive storytelling.

## Web Experience

### Core Features
- **Talent Stories:** Parallax narratives blending video reels, interviews, and fan art.
- **Geo-Targeted Content:** EU/APAC talent highlighted based on visitor location.
- **Agency DNA:** Interactive timeline showing their "discovery â†’ mentorship â†’ launch" process.

### Technical Implementation
- **No-Code Agility:** Webflow CMS for rapid talent profile updates.
- **Performance:** Scored 98/100 on PageSpeed via lazy-loaded assets and SVG optimization.
- **Motion Design:** GSAP animations triggered on scroll for narrative flow.

## Challenges & Solutions

**Problem:** Danish clients felt previous site was "too corporate"; international talent called it "too cold."  
**Solution:**  
- Ran A/B tests with 20+ creators to balance warmth/professionalism.  
- Added creator-led "Behind the Work" video diaries for authenticity.  

---

## Results
- **Client Acquisition:** 7 new EU talent signings within 3 months of launch.  
- **Industry Recognition:** Shortlisted for Awwwards Site of the Day (Motion Design).  
- **Creator Feedback:** *"Finally feels like a platform FOR artists, not just a directory."*

## Retrospective
**What Iâ€™d Do Differently:**  
- Built Webflow template system for faster talent onboarding.  
- Added AR previews for experiential creators.
