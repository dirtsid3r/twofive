## Project Overview

Pre-TikTok, Joynt pioneered "1,000 True Fans" economics â€“ helping niche creators monetise via chat-first intimacy, not viral fame.

---

## Strategy & Execution

### Core Innovations
- **Fan Clubs:** Threaded discussions around exclusive content "Boards".  
- **Creator Wallets:** One-click paywalls for courses, concerts, and Q&As.  
- **Anti-Algorithm:** Chronological feeds prioritising superfans over randoms.  

### Scaling Traction
- **Growth Hack:** Let fans co-create content with creators (e.g., music band Evergreenâ€™s songwriting boards).  
- **Virality:** "Pay-to-React" feature sparked 300k+ meme shares.  

---

## Challenges & Solutions

**Problem:** Creators feared paywalls would kill engagement.  
**Solution:**  
- Launched free "Preview Snippets" with gated full access.  
- Gave creators real-time fan sentiment dashboards.  

---

## Results
- **Engagement:** 100M+ monthly messages at peak.  
- **Monetisation:** Top creators earned Â£8k+/month.  
- **Exit:** Pivoted to video-first model post-SOSV investment.  

---

## Retrospective
**Key Learnings:**  
- Underestimated content moderation needs at scale.  
- Shouldâ€™ve built Patreon-style membership tiers earlier.
