# Cambium: Transdisciplinary Design in Horological Craftsmanship

![Cambium Banner](/images/cambium/banner.jpg)

## The Challenge

The modern relationship with time has become increasingly digital and disconnected from natural rhythms—a phenomenon at odds with growing environmental consciousness. In 2017, this observation catalyzed a unique design exploration: could we create timepieces that not only measured moments but also embodied nature's essence through material selection and thoughtful craftsmanship?

As a digital product designer venturing into physical product creation, I faced a foundational challenge: applying interface design principles to horological craftsmanship while respecting the unique constraints and opportunities of watchmaking.

## Strategic Approach

Embracing the ethos that design thinking transcends mediums, I applied a transdisciplinary approach to watchmaking:

### 1. Material Exploration and Selection

Moving beyond conventional watchmaking materials, I developed selection criteria for local woods that balanced:

- Aesthetic qualities that would evolve beautifully with age and wear
- Structural integrity requirements for daily use durability
- Sustainability considerations in sourcing and processing

### 2. Knowledge Acquisition Framework

Recognizing the knowledge gap between digital and physical craftsmanship, I created a deliberate learning journey:

- Apprenticed with an experienced watchmaker in Bangalore to understand horological fundamentals
- Developed rapid prototyping methodologies adapted from digital product development
- Created material testing protocols to validate durability assumptions

### 3. Design Synthesis Process

Rather than approaching the watches as mere aesthetic objects, I developed a design methodology that balanced:

- Functional requirements of precision timekeeping 
- Material properties and constraints of wood components
- Symbolic representation of nature's temporality through design elements

### 4. Constraint-Driven Innovation

Embracing limitations as creative catalysts, I developed innovative solutions at the intersection of wood and steel—creating a hybrid construction methodology that preserved the aesthetic warmth of wood while ensuring mechanical reliability.

## Key Challenges

The project presented unique challenges that required creative problem-solving:

- Designing within the inherent material constraints of wood—a living material with unique structural properties
- Balancing durability requirements with aesthetic goals—particularly at component interfaces
- Translating digital design approaches to physical craftsmanship without formal industrial design training

These challenges necessitated filling numerous sketchbooks with potential solutions—applying iterative design methodologies typically associated with digital products to physical craftsmanship.

## The Outcome

While resource constraints eventually redirected our focus to other projects, Cambium achieved several significant milestones:

- Successfully developed multiple working prototypes demonstrating the viability of wood-steel hybrid construction
- Created a distinctive aesthetic language that differentiated Cambium from conventional timepieces
- Produced video documentation capturing the design philosophy and craftsmanship approach
- Demonstrated how digital design thinking can successfully translate to physical product development

This exploration exemplifies how design curiosity can transcend medium boundaries—applying consistent problem-solving methodologies across digital and physical realms. Though the commercial journey paused, the design learning continues to inform my approach to all creative challenges, reinforcing the value of cross-disciplinary exploration.
