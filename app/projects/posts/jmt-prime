## Project Overview

High-net-worth travelers wanted curated experiences beyond JMT’s backpacker roots. We proved premium demand in 4 weeks with $0 engineering spend.

---

## Strategy & Execution

### No-Code Stack
- **Frontend:** Webflow + Memberstack for auth/payments  
- **Backend:** Airtable CMS + Zapier automations  
- **Media Pipeline:** User-generated content via Instagram API  

### Luxury Playbook
- **Influencer Collabs:** Partnered with 50+ micro-celebrities (100k-1M followers)  
- **Pricing Psychology:** Tested "all-inclusive" vs à la carte models (33% conversion lift)  
- **FOMO Engine:** "Group forming" alerts for sold-out adjacent dates  

---

## Challenges & Solutions

**Problem:** Users hesitated to pay 5x premium without physical touchpoints.  
**Solution:**  
- Launched "Host Dinner" – video call with trip leader pre-booking  
- Added 24hr concierge WhatsApp support  

---

## Results
- 💸 **£180k ARR** within 6 months  
- 🎫 11/31 luxury trips sold out in 30 days  
- 📈 19% repeat booking rate (vs 4% core product)  

---

## Retrospective
**What I’d Change:**  
- Built NFT-based loyalty program for exclusivity  
- Added helicopter/yacht booking integrations earlier
