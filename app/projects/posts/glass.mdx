## Project Overview

Glass is an AI-powered authentication platform that helps luxury brands combat counterfeit products. Using computer vision and blockchain verification, the system allows consumers to instantly verify product authenticity with just their smartphone camera.

---

## The Challenge

Counterfeit luxury goods cost brands over $30 billion annually. Traditional authentication methods (holograms, serial numbers) are easily replicated by sophisticated counterfeiters. Brands needed a solution that was:

1. Impossible to replicate
2. Easy for consumers to use
3. Scalable across global supply chains

---

## Solution Architecture

### Core Technology
- **Computer Vision Engine:** Trained on 500,000+ authentic vs. counterfeit product images
- **Blockchain Verification:** Immutable product history from manufacturing to retail
- **Consumer Mobile Interface:** Simple scan-to-verify experience requiring no downloads

### Key Features
- **Micropattern Recognition:** Detects manufacturing patterns invisible to the human eye
- **Supply Chain Tracking:** Full visibility of product journey for brands
- **Consumer Trust Portal:** Verification certificates shareable on social media

---

## Development Process

The project followed a phased approach:

1. **Research & Data Collection:** Partnered with 3 luxury brands to gather authentic and counterfeit samples
2. **AI Model Training:** Developed and refined computer vision algorithms (98.7% accuracy)
3. **Platform Development:** Built React frontend and Node.js backend with AWS infrastructure
4. **Pilot Program:** Launched with 2 brands across 5,000 products
5. **Full Deployment:** Scaled to 12 brands and 100,000+ products

---

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- TensorFlow.js for on-device image processing
- Progressive Web App for mobile-first experience

### Backend
- Node.js microservices architecture
- MongoDB for product data
- AWS S3 for image storage
- Hyperledger Fabric for blockchain verification

---

## Results & Impact

- **Brand Adoption:** 12 luxury brands implemented Glass within 8 months
- **Consumer Usage:** 40,000+ monthly verifications
- **Counterfeit Reduction:** 32% decrease in reported counterfeits for participating brands
- **ROI for Brands:** $4.2M estimated saved in counterfeit losses

---

## Lessons Learned

- **AI Training Challenges:** Needed continuous model retraining as counterfeiters adapted
- **User Experience:** Simplified initial 12-step verification process down to 3 steps
- **Enterprise Integration:** Created custom APIs for each brand's existing inventory systems
